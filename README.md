# EmpowerAble-ed-tech
Empower-Able is an inclusive web-based platform developed to support students with disabilities or limited resources in accessing quality education. The website is designed with accessibility and usability at its core, ensuring that every learner—regardless of physical, sensory, or environmental challenges—can engage effectively with educational content. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with MongoDB for the backend, Empower-Able provides a seamless user experience through interactive forms, animated navigation, and dynamic content loading. Users begin by entering their details, after which the system presents specialized options for different disabilities, including deafness, blindness, speech impairment, and limb disabilities. Each section offers tailored information, assistive technologies, and resources that enhance learning experiences for diverse needs. The project focuses on bridging the digital divide by providing a responsive, visually engaging, and accessible design that promotes equal learning opportunities. Empower-Able not only showcases inclusive technology but also raises awareness about the importance of accessibility in education, ensuring that no student is left behind due to disability or lack of resources.
